# Senior Thesis
My Senior Thesis for my BS in Computer Science, entitled "Enabling Close Proximity Human Robot Collaboration via Distributed, Self-
Calibrating Robotic Skin". 

The goal of this repo is to a). show my work and b). serve as a potential example for others doing their undergraduate thesis.

The three main files are:

- The form of approval signatures of the committee: [here](Matt_Strong_Final_Report_Thesis.pdf)
- The thesis itself: [here](Matt_Strong_Thesis.pdf)
- The thesis presentation: [here](Matt%20Strong's%20Thesis%20Defense%20Presentation.pdf )
